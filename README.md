# RandomTerrainGenerationUnity
 
 Random terrain generation using perlin noise to determine the height of vertices of a terrain mesh. Manipulating variables like amplitude, frequency and persistance gives unique terrain look on top of the random generation of said terrain.
 
 In this example, this method is used on a 100x100 terrain chunk. The same method can be used alongside chunk loading to make an 'infinite' random terrain generation.
 Materials and color can be aplied to terrain mesh as well.
